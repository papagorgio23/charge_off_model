```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

There is a live version of this model online found here: [http://sportsfirm.ai/shiny/charge-off-ffn/](http://sportsfirm.ai/shiny/charge-off-ffn/)


## Model Goals

The goal of this model is to predict whether or not a customer will repay their loan or not. The model is when the customer first falls behind in their payments. The target timeline for our prediction model is 6 months in the future. 

There are 2 different models that were built based on the type of loan the customer was given. They are labeled "F+" and "C+". 

+ **C+ loans** are consolidation loans, typically higher interest given to customers with poor credit to help them improve their credit rating.  
+ **F+ loans** are loans for other purposes to customers with average to above average credit ratings. 


From my analysis, I found that these customers behave differently requiring the need to build two separate models.
